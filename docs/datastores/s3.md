AWS S3 uses the AWS IAM authorization system to manage access to S3 buckets.
AWS IAM implements both role-based and attribute-based (session tags) control approaches.

AWS IAM lets you set allow or deny policies for an AWS Principal.
Taking into account the AWS policy evaluation processing (which simulates by the authz-analyzer),
the final allowed policies grant access for a principal to S3 bucket.

There are several types of AWS Principals IAM user, IAM role, Federated user, AWS Service, or anonymous principal.
AWS Principal has a set of permissions in policies, AKA identity-based policies to perform actions. For example, creating an object in S3 bucket. 

An AWS IAM role defines by trusted relationship policy in which principals allow from the same account or other accounts (AKA cross-accounts access) to assume this role and act as this role principal.

In addition to policies defined on an AWS principal, S3 bucket might also have a resource-based policy.
This policy can grants access directly to an AWS Principal.

Authz-analyzer analyzes all possible paths between an AWS principal to a S3 bucket.
It stimulates the AWS policy evaluation process, taking into account the allow/deny policies attached to the principal or S3 bucket, 
validate the chain of assuming roles in a path, and exposing the final allowed possible paths between AWS principal to S3 bucket

## Analyze AWS S3 Buckets
Authz-analyzer connects to AWS accounts and scans them.

Following are the parameters that authz-analyzer needs:

#### Target account
Authz-analyzer scans the s3 buckets from one single AWS account. We called this account the target account.

#### Additional accounts
In addition to the target account, authz-analyzer lets you supply additional accounts.
AWS allows cross-account access. Hence principal from account X can have access to the S3 bucket on the target account. 
To let the authz-analyzer resolves the principals between those accounts, you may supply additional AWS accounts.
Please note that authz-analyzer will not scan the s3 buckets on the additional accounts, only buckets belong to the target account.

#### Role name
Authz-analyzer uses the IAM role to connect to the target/additional AWS account.
It assumed a predefined IAM role which should have the permissions to let the authz-analyzer get the information it needs.
You should create such role for every relevant AWS account, the same role name between all accounts is required.

#### External ID
In AWS cross-account access, the best practice when assuming AWS role is the use external-ID.
This solves the "confused deputy" security issue.


### Setup Access to Scan an AWS Account

To enable authz-analyzer to scan the IAM principals to S3 buckets permissions, perform the following steps:
1. For each AWS account, create a role to be assumed by the authz-analyzer (should be the same name on all accounts)
2. Attached the following policy to the new role
```

                "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Add the following statement to the roleâ€™s Trust Relationships
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "<ARN-TRUSTED-PRINCIPAL>"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": <EXTERNAL-ID>
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
The ARN-TRUSTED-PRINCIPAL is the AWS ARN of the authenticated principal which running the authz-analyzer.

### Scanning an AWS 
```
authz-analyzer aws-s3 \
    --target-account-id <AWS target account id> \
    --additional-account-id <AWS additional account id> \
    --role-name <ROLE-NAME>
    --external-id <EXTERNAL-ID>
```
The --additional-account-id is multiple optional parameter, which means you may mention it zero or more in order to add multiple AWS additional account ids
